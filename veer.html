  <div class = "des">
  <p>"We have seen more and more people started to get interested in creating 360 videos, however, quite a few of them is still new to the process and techniques of making a good 360 video. They can be totally new to VR but curious about finding out how it works, or just brought their first 360 camera but still figuring out to make nice 360 videos.As the global VR video community, we want to help these creators by providing them a centralized place for them to learn these skills and exchange knowledge." - VeeR VR</p>

  <div class = "des">
  <p>VeeR VR hopes to create an online tutorial platform for 360 video by collecting creating instructions for its upcoming creators. In the current website, VR tutorial is just a sub-page under the Blog.</p>

  <div class="gallery-flex">
  <img class="gallery-item" src="images/veer_3.jpg" alt = "competitor analysis 1"/>
  <img class="gallery-item" src="images/veer_4.jpg" alt = "competitor analysis 2"/>

  <h4>Key Findings</h4>
  <p>1.Users prefer clean course lists like Coursera most.</p>
  <p>2.A well-arranged filter is useful such as Codeacademy.</p>
  <p>3.Syllabus should be shown clearly on the page.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Survey & Interview</h3>
  <p>Based on 30 surveys and 5 in-depth interviews, we developed several key findings and then translated them into two personas, which represents a target userâ€™s common characteristic to think about her motivation, goals, and frustrations. This persona helps us think about what our users need and how they feel, which in advance guide our design.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>Key findings</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>The homepage needs novice guidance and introduction.</li>
      <li>Picture size and layout also need a unified, standardized and tidy and the appropriate text instructions and guidance.</li>
      <li>Website must be more orderly and straightforward with unnecessary information removed.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>

  <h3>Persona</h3>

  <h2>DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
  <h3>Brainstorm & Affinity Map</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="gallery-flex">
  <img class="gallery-item" src="images/veer_8.jpg" alt = "brainstorm"/>
  <img class="gallery-item" src="images/veer_9.jpg" alt = "affinity map"/>
  </div>

  <div class = "des">
  <p>Through group brainstorm and votes for later affinity map, we achieved our design solutions as follows:</p>
  <h4>Homepage</h4>
  <p>1.Display sample works of courses in the heading position to attract users and prolong their stay.</p>
  <p>2.Design a filter for searching courses by both contents and levels.</p>
  <p>3.Show clear course lists especially including Sample Works and Course Abstract.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>Course Page</h4>
  <p>1.Design two learning modes including the scrolling-down mode and the screen one for users to switch.</p>
  <p>2.Design a course syllabus canvas for users to skip anywhere quickly.</p>
  <p>3.Design easy pathways to Course Project & Sample Works / Q&A / Related Courses respectively.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Storyboard</h3>

  <h3>First Round Usability Test</h3>
  <h4>Homepage</h4>
  <p>1.Showing the sample work is great for attracting users to learn the course.</p>
  <p>2.The 'Enter Course' button can be more intuitive so there will be less repetitive content.</p>
  <p>3.The brief introduction of each course could be shown.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>Course Page</h4>
  <p>1.Syllables is very helpful for users to self-navigate their learning process.</p>
  <p>2.The related courses are not necessary in the course page.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Second Round Usability Test</h3>
  <h4>Key Findings</h4>
  <p>1.Users prefer real-time FAQs be reached all through the course.</p>
  <p>2.With fewer contents on the page, it is easier for users to make their next steps.</p>
