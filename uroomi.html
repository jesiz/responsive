  <p>As the new school year in Ann Arbor starts, students are looking for new houses and new communities to move in and stay for the following year. However, the common problems related to new apartment search is: students do not know where to find the roommate if the leasing office needs the tenants to sign the lease for the whole apartment, or students do not know any about the new roommates before moving in if the leasing office assigns the roommates for them. A failure of roommate match will directly cause mental pressure and money loss and for the students, somehow decrease the number of potential tenants for the apartment, and result in unhappy and unstable student community.</p>

  <h3>First Round Usability Test</h3>
  <p>1. When users enter each preferences, they are expected to click back to the main preference page to start match, but all of them did it wrong responded that it would be better to go next as a continuous experience instead of going back to start match.</p>
  <p>2. The users are not sure where the ‘upload ID’ button on account setting and the ‘confirm button’ on the preference setting will take them to.</p>
  <p>3. The photo privacy setting should be in account setting/profile instead of preference setting.</p>
  <p>4. Users are not sure about the functions of the first three buttons in the bottom bar, the name should be added to them.</p>
  <p>5. The users do not know after clicking on ‘confirm’ on each preference page they need to go back to the main preference page, the path must be improved by continuous experience.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Second Round Usability Test</h3>
  <p>1. Log out should be at bottom of ‘Account’ page with the same font as notifications.</p>
  <p>2. Do not understand how to make the match open.</p>
  <p>3. Do not know how to click on one button on ‘Bookmark’ page to talk to Jessica, spent a long time to find the button.</p>
  <p>4. Cannot Find ‘Logout’.</p>
  <p>5. The app could be more simple and some of the functions could be combined.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
  <h4>1. Login/sign up and set up the account including UMid verification; Edit personal profile; Turn ‘New March Open’ on</h4>
  <p>UrooMi request users to sign up with an email(possibly umich email), and set up an account including upload UMID or work certification as identification verifications.</p>
  <p>From the top of the page ‘Account,’ the user could access the personal information editing page from button ‘Edit Profile.’ The profile is not for system filtering but are displayed for browsing page and let users know each other more.
  <p>The button ‘New Match Open’ is to make the profiles on public for other users to browse.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>2. Enter housing preferences</h4>
  <p>The main page for preferences has five subpages with five steps as a continuous flow. The five steps are divided into two parts: housing and lifestyle.</p>
  <p>Housing preferences are composed by step 1:  move-in date and step 2: housing and roommate type. Step 1 is for users to choose when to move in based on school semesters. Step 2 allows the users to determine what kind of housing they are looking for such as residential apartments and townhouse. And the users need to choose the current condition of house rentals if they do not sign a lease yet or they are looking for a roommate to move into the house that they already rent.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>3. Enter lifestyle preferences</h4>
  <p>Lifestyle preference is step 3-5, which are a personal lifestyle, roommate preference, and top preferences. The filters for lifestyle preferences come from the previous research, and they are finalized as the five points that people care the most about the roommates’ lifestyles: smoking, pet, party, cleanness and activity time frame. The users need to identify themselves’ lifestyles first and choose their expectations for roommates after.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>4. Enter 3 top preferences</h4>
  <p>On the last step to set lifestyle preference, the users could choose up to three points they ranked as the top 3 things that they cannot bear to avoid the people they will hate with no doubts.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>5. System match pending</h4>
  <p>After filling in those preferences, the user will go back to the main page for preferences. They could always click on preference buttons make adjustments. There is one large round button ‘Start Match’ in the middle of the page. Clicking on this button will bring the user to the system match progress, and come out with the result of profiles on page ‘Home’ that the application system automatically matched for the users.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>6. Browse the potential roommate automatically matched by the system</h4>
  <p>The system matches the suitable roommates for users based on their preference information automatically, and the match result brings the user to the homepage of UrooMi, which is the browse page with potential roommates’ profiles. The user could view more pictures and contact information, or start the conversation directly. The user could also bookmark the people they are interested in by clicking the small heart on the left-up corner.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>7. Communicate with the potential roommate</h4>
  <p>UrooMi provided the communication platform to let the users have the conversation with the potential roommates directly. Users could easily access to conversations by clicking on ‘Start to Talk’ button on the page ‘Home’ or the chats icons following the names on the page ‘Bookmark’. On the page ‘Chats’ the user could see all the past conversations. People who are bookmarked will have hearts followed with their profile pictures.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>8. Bookmark the interested potential roommates to a list</h4>
  <p>All the bookmarked potential roommates are stored in the page of bookmark. The user could talk to them or recheck their profiles by clicking the two buttons after the names.</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>9. Turn ‘New March Open’ off and log out</h4>
  <p>After the users find their new roommate and need to hide their profiles from the public to private, they could easily switch the button from open to close and log out.</p>
